Based on the companion website of Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager'.
An approach that promotes modern CSS with methodologies, fluid type & space, flexible Layouts and Progressive Enhancement.

This starter exists to hopefully spread the use of this _excellent_ workflow. To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

- Find out more on https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/.
- Remix the original: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/build-excellent-websites

Edit your preferences (colors, fonts, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/css/design-tokens`.
