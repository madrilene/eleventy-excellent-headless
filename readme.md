## Credits and Thank yous

**Heydon Pickering**

I strongly orientate myself on Heydon's approaches and love his books.

**Andy Bell**

His CSS methodology makes sense to me. I'm still working on understanding it fully and using it consistently. It also goes hand in hand with the Every Layout solutions he co-authors. An ardent opponent of the utility class framework Tailwind CSS. But has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. This is built into my website and I'm working on tweaking it.
I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love order and structure. Aleksandr Hovhannisyan does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his online resume and blog. Also, he writes great tutorials in his blog.

He created a fantastic CSS course that I am currently working through. Also, his in-depth tutorials are a great resource.
