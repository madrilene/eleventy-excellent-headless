# Eleventy starter

Opiniated but easy to use Eleventy starter, based on the workflow suggested by Andy Bell's buildexcellentwebsit.es.

If you end up using this starter, feel free to send me a link, I'd love to see it!
Also let me know if you miss any features. Currently in planning: automatically generated OpenGraph images (as fallback) and dark mode.

## Features

**This starter includes:**

- The whole CSS workflow as suggested by buildexcellentwebsit.es
- Accessible site navigation, editable in `src/_data/navigation.js`
- Image optimization with Eleventy-img _(see blog post)_
- Youtube embed with lite-youtube _(see blog post)_
- Easy resource fetching with eleventy-fetch _(see blog post)_
- Syntax highlighting via eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight _(see blog post)_
- SEO basics (XML-sitemap, metadata)

- Advanced markdown handling
- Bundling via esbuild
- RSS feed
- Links to social networks in footer
- Mastodon domain verification snippet
- Eleventy Fetch plugin set to fetch Wordpress Posts via REST API

## First steps

- **Important:** edit meta data in `src/_data/meta.js`, it's being used all over the template.
- Use your own Wordpress source for posts in `src/_data/posts.js`
- Search for 'eleventy-excellent.netlify.app'. You'll find an entry in `src/assets/css/global/global-styles.css`. Replace with your own domain.
- Edit your social media in `src/_data/social.js` and `src/_includes/icons`. If you add new icons they must be prefixed with "social-". By default you have rss, mastodon, twitter, ko-fi, linkedin and github. Great resource: https://lucide.dev/
- Not required, but recommended: Delete `github.js` in `src/_data/github.js` and the blog posts, as these serve only as an example.
- Edit your preferences (colors, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/assets/css/design-tokens`.
- Optional: set your (favicon) icons in `src/assets/images/favicon`.

## Credits and Thank yous

**Andy Bell**

His CSS methodology "CUBE" makes sense to me. It goes hand in hand with _Every Layout_ (which he co-authors). He has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. Also, I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love order and structure. Aleksandr does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his personal site. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from his blog.
